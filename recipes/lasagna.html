    <p>The fettuccine pasta used in this recipe is a delicious alternative to the typical lasagna noodle. Serve with a green salad and crusty Italian bread.</p>
    <ul>Ingredients:
        <li>12 ounces dry fettuccine pasta</li>
        <li>1 pound lean ground beef (Optional)</li>
        <li>1 cup chopped onion</li>
        <li>1 cup red bell pepper, chopped</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>1 (29 ounce) can diced tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 (4 ounce) can sliced mushrooms</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons chopped black olives</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons dried oregano</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of mushroom soup</li>
        <li>¼ cup beef broth</li>
        <li>¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>Instructions
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook pasta for 8 to 10 minutes, or until al dente; drain.</li>
        <li>In a large skillet, brown beef over medium heat. Drain fat from pan, and transfer meat to a bowl. In the same skillet, cook onion and bell pepper in butter until tender. Stir in tomatoes, mushrooms, olives, and beef, and season with oregano. Simmer for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13 inch baking dish.</li>
        <li>Arrange half of the cooked fettuccine in the prepared dish, top with half of the beef and vegetable mixture, and sprinkle with 1/2 cup of Cheddar cheese and 1/2 cup of mozzarella cheese. Repeat layers. Mix together soup and beef broth until smooth, and pour over casserole. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven for 30 to 35 minutes, or until heated through.</li>
